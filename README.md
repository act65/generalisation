There are a few different types of error when learning;
approximation, optimization and estimation error.

* Approximation error is due to the limits of your approximator/function class
* Optimisation error is due to the fact that we normally truncate the optimisation process before it converges. Aka early stopping.
* Estimation error is due to the fact that we dont have access to the true data distribution, but rather empirical estimate.
<!-- * ?? error (what other types of error are there) -->

In this we explore estimation error, aka generalisaion (although, ). And is closely related to over/under fitting.
